# gcb-rtl/integration — Vortex-side staging RTL

Draft RTL that belongs in the **Vortex 3.0 tree**, not the GreenCoyote-Bay pilot.
Tracked here so it is reviewed and versioned alongside the contract it
implements; **never synthesised into the pilot** — `scripts/build.tcl` globs only
`rtl/*.sv` and `rtl/generated/*.sv`, so this directory is outside the build.

| File | Implements | Spec |
|------|-----------|------|
| `VX_tcu_tilefinal_tag.sv` | Inline wrapper around `VX_tcu_core` that emits `is_tile_final` (aligned to `result_if.valid`) by mirroring the core's `mdata_queue` push/pop ordering. Gates the optical-reduction stream to the last-K accumulator writeback per (m,n) sub-tile. | `gcb-spec/vortex_integration_notes.md` §8; `gcb-spec/carry_save_streaming_contract.md` §8–§9 |

**Status:** draft. Compile and check against the chosen `VX_CFG_*` set using the
SVA + directed test in `vortex_integration_notes.md` §8.4 before wiring the shim.
Framing: civil compute-integration engineering.
